# Scrum
# I interpret user-stories through identifying problems that they rae facing and look to solution that can fix that problem
# I would identify the work , break it down so it can be completed in an iterative fashion , plan our sprint based on that and finally collaborate with the team
# to be a good memeber would be to be open to ideas , be a good listener , understand what other members are going thru and be open to working as a team , be respectful to everyone and focus on the collective goal for the team.
